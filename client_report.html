            <h1>Client Report</h1>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?</h2>
                <p>
                    The client gave us the images we were supposed to use. I followed it from there, including using the wireframe granted to us.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?</h2>
                <p>
                    We mainly communicated in-person, sometimes there would be messages left between us on this page; for reference, those have been mostly removed.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, he liked what we did and he didn't have any major complaints.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, I would establish more defined communication protocols, as just meeting in person wasn't terribly consistent. Secondly, I would try to have more frequent check-ins to ensure that the project is on track and aligns with my vision. Lastly, I would provide more detailed feedback throughout the development process to help guide the team.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?</h2>
                <p>
                    We communicated mostly in-person, and there were no major issues. However, I think having a more structured communication plan could have improved our collaboration. That said, I did get one of the pages quite late, as the invitations for whatever reason were not working.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Did you know what was expected of you for each site?</h2>
                <p>
                    For the first one, yes. The second one, not so much, as I was not given the wireframe until quite late in the process. Even then, there were quite a few hiccups in the process.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Were you able to contribute to your sites?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, I did my part in working with the team to ensure that the content and images were appropriate for the site. I also provided feedback on the design and layout to help improve the overall user experience.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding pages to your site?</h2>
                <p>
                    Shockingly, that was the only thing that consistently worked. I had no issues with GitHub at all.
                </p>
